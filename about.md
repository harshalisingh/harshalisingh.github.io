title: About Me
---

Hi, my name is Harshali Singh and I am a Computer Science Graduate student at Northeastern University living in Boston, MA. I am passionate about Software Development, Product Management, Data Science and Machine Learning. 

I am currently working at Red Hat, Raleigh office as a Product Management Intern in the JBoss Application Platforms team. I have done my previous co-op at Boston Consulting Group in the Business Systems Group as a Software Engineering Co-op. I was primarily responsible for building enhancements to existing BCG's finance applications and developing new Administrative features using ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, NHibernate, JQuery, etc.

Earlier, I worked at Microsoft, India for about 2 years in the ASP.NET/IIS team. I was hired as part of the [Microsoft Academy of College Hires](https://careers.microsoft.com/students/mach) (popularly known as MACH) program which is as an 18-24 month accelerated career development program for recently graduated students. As part of this program, I underwent intensive training on various Microsoft Products and gained leadership, networking and technical skills.

I also have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology, University of Mumbai. 

This blog is to document my learnings in software development, data science and computer science in general. I enjoy cooking, travelling, photography and watching funny cat videos.
